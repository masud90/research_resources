# Research Resources

As a researcher, it is essential to have a streamlined workflow in order to efficiently manage time, data, literature, and communication. In this guide, we aim to provide an overview of the various tools and resources that can aid in optimizing the workflow of development researchers, humanitarians, academics, and quantitative researchers.

The tools and resources outlined in this guide can aid in the management of time, research, data, communication, storage, backup, automation, learning, and stress management. However, it is important to note that this guide is not exhaustive and it is recommended that researchers conduct their own investigation to determine which tools and resources best suit their needs. Additionally, this guide should not be considered an endorsement of any specific tools or resources.

The target audience for this guide includes, but is not limited to, students, development researchers, academics, humanitarians, and quantitative researchers. However, it is likely that the tools and resources mentioned in this guide can also be of use to other professionals and researchers working in related fields.

It is worth noting that some tools or resources may have paid versions and/or freemium models, therefore it is important to carefully read the terms of service and determine the best option for your needs before using the tool.

In summary, this guide serves as a starting point for identifying tools and resources that can aid in optimizing the workflow of a researcher. It is recommended that researchers conduct their own investigation and experimentation to determine which tools and resources best suit their specific needs.

N.B.: Services marked with a :star: next to their names are services we use productively and/or frequently.
